# portfolioSite
It was great challenged for me as a non-tech background student to build this first portfolio page. at starting i had no idea how to built this. but once i completed my html and less than half portion of css i got idea to build this.

Problems which i have faced during project:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I could not able to upload images on Deployment site where as it works on VS Code. When my project was completed and ran i couldn't see the image and then later i realized that i had to save the project's HTML and CS file and images all in one folder and add it to the Github account and then i did it and all After i started seeing photos in the project and on Netifly. You can imagine how much you can be Happy when its done and you do it yourself.

The Style of image:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was trying to give different effect to photo's but it didn't work out and then i searched for it on Google and found out the effect and then i added it to my project.I realise that time ,you will get all the information or you can understand by your own if you search by your own and studying it.

Background color of page:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I tried a lot of color combinations for the background but those colors didn't match the text.by searching on google i got the color combination effect which is linear- gradient effect.then i used it as background color. it was looking awsome so kept it.

Submission of project:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I completed this project on 8th july 2022.it was not my target but my aim was that whatever i will do it should be perfect so ,i didnt think about timing and duration to complete the project because it was my first project on portfolio page ,This strength will help me to complete my upcoming projects in proper schedule and in time.

Feeling after completion:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my first and simple Portfolio Website and this portfolio is a representation of all that i've learned as a Student and starting Developer as my career. It was great experiance and really enjoyed the entire process.THANK YOU !!
